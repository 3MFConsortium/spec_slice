# ![3mf logo](images/3mf_logo_50px.png) 3MF Slice Extension

This repository contains the full specification for the 3MF Slice extension.

This 3MF beam lattice specification is an extension to the core 3MF specification. This document cannot stand alone and only applies as an addendum to the core 3MF specification. Usage of this and any other 3MF extensions follow an a la carte model, defined in the core 3MF specification.

See the [3MF Slices examples repository](https://github.com/3MFConsortium/3mf-samples/tree/master/examples/slices) for 3MF sample files that include slices.
